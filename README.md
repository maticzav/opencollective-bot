## Deployment

**Summary**: This project is currently deployed with [Now](https://zeit.co/now) (v2). To deploy to staging or production, you need to be a core member of the Open Collective team.

See: [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)

# Development

> This abbreviated guide is meant to give a guide as to how github apps are made and basic steps to reproduce the OpenCollective Bot should you wish to make futher changes.

Visit the [Github App Docs](https://developer.github.com/apps/quickstart-guides/setting-up-your-development-environment/) for a full documentation on Github Apps

## Installation

Feel free to clone or download this project using the **git clone** and install using **Yarn install** to install required dependencies

**WebHooks** are crucial to production **Github Apps**. Hence, you can use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com) , [Smee](https://smee.io) or other comfortable options .

> **Smee** which is supported by **Probot** is however used in this guide .

### Setting up Smee

> Visit the [Smee](https://smee.io) website, to start a new channel

-After creating a channel, take note of the **Webhook Proxy URL** shown as it would be used as the **Webhook Url** in the about page when resgistering the app on github

- `npm i -g smee-client` to install the **smee client**

### Registering App

- Follow steps listed at [Github](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app/) to register your bot.

- For the **Homepage URL**, use the **Webhook Proxy URL** generated by Smee

- After a succesfull registration, generate a `private key`(file with a `.pem` extension ), rename to `private.pem` and store in the root project folder .

After registering the app, take note of the **App ID** shown in the about page

> Settings used can be changed later, incase of any changes such as the **Webhook URL**

#### Credentials

> `Dotenv-cli` is used to handle credentials within this project

- Create a `.env` file in the working directory with the following variabes below

```js
 APP_ID = <App ID>
 WEBHOOK_SECRET = development
 PRIVATE_KEY_PATH = < `.pem` file placed in the `cwd`> e.g `PRIVATE_KEY_PATH = "private.pem"`
```

- **APP_ID** takes the App_id found at the **about** page.

### Installation and Inspecting

- Run `Yarn dev` to start the bot locally and this should start the bot on port `3000`

Once fully setup, you can install it within any already existing repository to test and see it work

Open your **Smee URL** in any browser to view and inspect incoming payloads
