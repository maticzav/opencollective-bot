## Deployment

**Summary**: This project is currently deployed with [Now](https://zeit.co/now) (v2). To deploy to staging or production, you need to be a core member of the Open Collective team.

See: [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)

## Development

> This is a guide on how to run the OpenCollective Bot locally.

Visit the [Github App Docs](https://developer.github.com/apps/quickstart-guides/setting-up-your-development-environment/) for a full documentation on Github Apps

### **Local Installation**

Clone this project using the `git clone` command and install dependencies with `yarn` using the `yarn install` command to install all required dependencies.

**WebHooks** are crucial to production **Github Apps**. This project which was built using **Probot** relies on **Smee** for Webhooks

### Setting up Smee

> Visit the [Smee](https://smee.io) website, to start a new channel

- The **Webhook Proxy URL** generated by **Smee** should be noted as it would be used as the **Webhook Url** in the **Github App Settings** when registering the app on github.

- `npm i -g smee-client` to install the **smee client**

### Registering App

> **Github App Settings** can be found at `https://github.com/settings/apps`

- For the **Homepage URL**, use the the link to the repository where the Github App is placed. E.g https://github.com/test_user/test_bot

- After a succesfull registration, generate a `private key`(file with a `.pem` extension ), rename to `private-key.pem` and store in the root project folder .

- Generate a unique secret with `openssl rand -base64 32` and use the secret as the webhook secret.
  > **Note:** Webhook Secret used here must match with `WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env` file within project folder.

#### Permissions

The **Open Collective Bot** comments on issues based on whether the author is already a backer of your Open Collective. It can also tag issues based on the same information. Inorder to achieve this, the following permissions need to be enabled from the **Github App Settings** ;

- Issues = Read and Write
- Organization members = Read only

After registering the app, take note of the **App ID** shown in the **Github App Settings** .

> Settings used can be changed later, incase of any changes such as the **Webhook URL**

### Environment Variables

> `dotenv-cli` is used to handle environment variables for development .

- Create a `.env` file in the working directory with the following variabes below

```js
 APP_ID = <App ID>
 WEBHOOK_SECRET = development
 PRIVATE_KEY_PATH = private-key.pem
```

> **APP_ID** takes the App_id found at the **Github App Settings**.

### Running Locally

- Run `yarn dev` to start the bot locally and this should start the bot on port `3000`

Once fully setup, you can install it within any already existing repository to test and see it work

> Github Apps can be installed on repositories visiting the [Github App Settings](https://github.com/settings/apps) and navigating to the **Intsall App** column in the left vertical tab.

Open your **Smee URL** in any browser to view and inspect incoming payloads
