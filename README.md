## Deployment

**Summary**: This project is currently deployed with [Now](https://zeit.co/now) (v2). To deploy to staging or production, you need to be a core member of the Open Collective team.

See: [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)

# Development

> This short guide is meant to give a guide as to how github apps are made and basic steps to reproduce the OpenCollective Bot should you wish to make futher changes.

## Installation

Feel free to clone or download this project using the **git clone** and install using **Yarn install** to install required dependencies

**WebHooks** are crucial to **Github Apps**. Hence, you can use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com) , [Smee](https://smee.io) or other comfortable options .

> **Ngrok** is however used in this guide .

### Running Ngrok

> After making all necessary local Ngrok installations found here [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com)

- Run `Ngrok http <{localhost port}>` from your downloaded `Ngrok.exe` to create a tunnel in your terminal.
- Take note of the **Web Interface** generated as it would be needed when registering the App on github.

### Registering App

> Follow steps listed at [Github](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app/) to register your bot.
> Use the **Web Interface** as **Webhook Url** when registering the app on Github.

#### Credentials

After registering the app, take note of the **App ID** shown in the about page

> Using a `.env` file in this project is highly recommended to store your credentials

- Create a new `.env` file at the root folder and copy the code below into it.

```js
 APP_ID = <App ID>
 WebHook_Secret =
 Private_Key =
```

- Copy the App Id found at the **about** page and insert into the App Id value in the `.env` file .

- Generate a Private Key at the **Private Keys** column found in the about page, save the `.pem` file, and copy the values found next to the Private key found into the `.env` file . E.g `53:55:64:04:b1:4a:80:ff:9c:79:8e:48:b2:a2:13:84:9f:c5:71:c4`

- Run `openssl rand -base64 32` in a terminal with **Openssl** installed, copy the key generated and paste into the Webhook Secret in the `.env` file.

### Installation and Inspecting

> Run `Yarn dev` to start the bot locally.

Once fully setup, you can install it within any already existing repository to test and see it work

Ngrok out of the box, provides the ability to inspect incoming traffic running over your tunnels. To do this, open the **localhost ** url shown in your terminal in your browser.
