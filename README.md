# Development

> This short guide is meant to give a guide to how github apps are made, and basic steps to reproduce the OpenCollective Bot should you wush to fix any bug.

... Note Probot was used to build the Github app hence certain details may be specific to **Probot**

## Installation

Feel free to clone or download this project using the **git clone** and install using **Yarn install** or **Npm install** to install required dependencies

Github apps make a large use of **WebHooks**. Hence, you can use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com) , [Smee](https://smee.io) or other comfortable options .

### Running Ngrok

> After making all necessary local Ngrok installations found here [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com)

- Run `Ngrok http <{localhost port}>` and copy the web address it gives into the your `.env` file

### Registering App

> Follow steps found here [Github](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app/)

#### Handling Credentials

After registering the app, take note of the following listed details shown in the about page 

- App ID
- Client ID
- Client Secret


> Using a `.env` file is highly recommended and also including it in your `.gitignore` file.

- Install `dotenv` package and import into the index file
- Create a new `.env` file at the root folder

```js
export GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID=<your app client id>
export GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=<your app client secret>
export GITHUB_APP_ID=<your app id>
export GITHUB_APP_PEM=<base64 encoded contents of your pem file>
```

> Copy and paste the above code into the newly create `.env` file and replace the bracketed values with the correct data



### Installation and  Inspecting
Once fully setup, you can install it within any already existing repository to test and see it work 


Ngrok out of the box, provides the ability to inspect incoming traffic running over your tunnels. To do this, open the **localhost ** url shown in your terminal in your browser.
